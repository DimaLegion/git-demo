This time, This place 
Misused, Mistakes 
Too long, Too late 
Who was I to make you wait 
Just one chance 
Just one breath 
Just in case there's just one left 
'Cause you know, 
you know, you know 

[CHORUS] 
That I love you 
I have loved you all along 
And I miss you 
Been far away for far too long 
I keep dreaming you'll be with me 
and you'll never go 
Stop breathing if 
I don't see you anymore 

On my knees, I'll ask 
Last chance for one last dance 
'Cause with you, I'd withstand 
All of hell to hold your hand 
I'd give it all 
I'd give for us 
Give anything but I won't give up 
'Cause you know, 
you know, you know
